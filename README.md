This is a description and demonstration of the local linear embedding algorithm for data visualization. It was based on the algorithm described [here](https://cs.nyu.edu/~roweis/lle/algorithm.html) and first described in Roweis, S. T., & Saul, L. K. (2000). See the included notebook for the writeup.
